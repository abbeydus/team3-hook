How to contribute to a project :

I will make a directory using Mkdir and cd into dir
I will clone the repo using git clone repository
I will create my working branch and switch into it using git checkout -b branch name
I will create Jenkinsfile and make update/write into the file
I will do a git add . to add my file to the staging area
I will do a git commit -m “message”
I will do a git push
I will create the upstream branch
Then I will create a pull request and assign it to my lead Engineer for review and approval
Finally I will merger my branch into the development branch
